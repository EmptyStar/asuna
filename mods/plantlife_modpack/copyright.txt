Ironzorg's Flowers mod served as the basis for the three mods that eventually 
went into creating this file.  Any code still remaining from that mod is 
entirely his work (though I'm pretty sure it's all been phased out).

Flowers textures by Ironzorg.

Junglegrass textures are modified copies of the original one from the game's 
default set.

All remaining code, textures, etc. by Vanessa Ezekowitz.
