Cats are often found near Human 
settlements. While typically skittish, their 
trust can initially be gained by feeding 
them, and further increased by playing. 
They don't follow commands well but will 
do better as their trust grows. However, 
some habits never die. If you have Cats in 
your home, never leave down glass vessels 
unless you want them destroyed.
