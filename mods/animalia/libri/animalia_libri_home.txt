This is a journal of all the 
Animals you've met in this 
world. When you find an 
Animal you wish to log in this 
Journal, simply right-click it. 
Doing so will give valuable 
information on the Animal, 
including the biomes it 
inhabits, if and and how it can 
be tamed, and a general 
overview of it's behavior. 

Good luck, Explorer!
