Horses are a large mammal found in open 
plains. They're commonly used for 
transportation, as they can run at high 
speed for vast distances without tiring. To 
tame one, you have to mount it and keep 
your view aligned with the Horse's. After 
taming, the Horse can be saddled and 
ridden. Not every Horse is created equal, 
some can jump tremendous heights, and 
others can run faster. Horses will pass 
these attributes down to their offspring.
