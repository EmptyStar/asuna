Chickens are a flightless bird, most often 
found in Jungles. They live in tight flocks, 
wandering along the floor in search of bugs. 
Males, also called Roosters, are visually 
distinguised from Females, or hens, by their 
large tail feathers. Chickens are a popular 
choice among farmers since they can 
reliably produce eggs, giving a consistent 
source of food.
