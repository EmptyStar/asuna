Asuna
=====

Welcome to the vast and vibrant world of Asuna! Journey through a potpourri of natural wonders as you traverse beautiful and breathtaking landscapes. Forests, meadows, jungles, tundras, deserts, swamps, and more await you at every horizon.

This passion project brings together some of the very best biome and world decoration mods that the Minetest community has published. Much of Asuna's beauty is owed to the mod authors who have openly shared the fruits of their hard work and imagination. Asuna stands to honor these authors and their work.

**NOTE: This game is currently a work in progress!** [Bug reports and feature requests are welcome](https://github.com/EmptyStar/asuna/issues).

Gameplay
--------

Asuna's features provide a beautiful setting for your own adventures and creations, and a colorful palette with which to create. It's up to you to write your own story, to build your own marvels, and to find your own purpose.

While Asuna is a traditional voxel sandbox game at its core, some provided gameplay features are listed below. For even more gameplay options, check out [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/) to find mods that can fulfill all of your wildest dreams.

All gameplay elements listed below are made optional and configurable via `Settings > All Settings > Content: Games > Asuna`.

### Nutrition

Players in the world of Asuna benefit from helpful effects granted by staying well fed. A derivative of the "hunger" concept, Asuna revamps this familiar gameplay mechanic to be strictly beneficial to players in a way that aids in exploration and survival. Players will enjoy the following effects when they have eaten:

- Increased movement speed (up to +25% when full)
- The ability to sprint (+100% movement speed while holding the `aux1` key)
- Health regeneration (chance to recover health every five seconds)
- Resistance to poisonous foods (chance to lose nutrition instead of health)

These effects are most pronounced when a player is fully satiated and will diminish gradually as a player becomes hungry. Hunger will only diminish these effects and cannot hurt players unless starvation is explicitly enabled via game settings (disabled by default). Other settings exist to disable nutrition altogether and to modify how slowly or how quickly players become hungry.

This functionality is implemented using a modified version of the [Stamina](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sofar/stamina/) mod.
