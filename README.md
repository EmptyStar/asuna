Asuna
=====

Welcome to the vast and vibrant world of Asuna! Journey through a potpourri of natural wonders as you traverse beautiful and breathtaking landscapes. Forests, meadows, jungles, tundras, deserts, swamps, and more await you at every horizon.

This passion project brings together some of the very best biome and world decoration mods that the Minetest community has published. Much of Asuna's beauty is owed to the mod authors who have openly shared the fruits of their hard work and imagination. Asuna stands to honor these authors and their work.

**NOTE: This game is currently a work in progress!**

Features

Gameplay
--------

Asuna's features provide a beautiful setting for your own adventures and creations, and a colorful palette with which to create. It's up to you to write your own story, to build your own marvels, and to find your own purpose.

If you're looking for a game that delivers:

- Complex and rewarding new survival mechanics
- Emergent gameplay based on new dimensions of world interaction
- A deep progression system that brings players to new heights of power

...then it's up to you to construct these experiences because Asuna provides **none of this**! Asuna utilizes but a fraction of what the Minetest community has to offer to its fellow modders and players.
